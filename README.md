# meals_app

This project is a group assignment for NTNU course IDATA2503, where we are to build an Meals app for mobile. We will heavily follow a [udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps/?couponCode=24T4MT90924A) course and add our own features on top of that. In this case it will be a way to randomly select a meal, if you have a hard time choosing for yourself.

## User stories

User stories for our meals app.

| **User** | **Story**                                                                                                                                            |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| User 1   | As a user, I want to browse different categories of meals, so that I can easily find meals based on my preference.                                   |
| User 2   | As a user, I want to view detailed recipes and ingredient lists for each meal, so that I can follow the steps to prepare the dish at home.           |
| User 3   | As a user, I want to filter meals by dietary preferences like vegan, gluten-free, etc., so that I can quickly find meals that meet my dietary needs. |
| User 4   | As a user, I want to add meals to my favorites list, so that I can easily access my favorite meals later.                                            |
| User 5   | As a user, I want to see an image of each meal, so that I can visually evaluate whether I might want to try it.                                      |
| User 6   | As a user, I want to see preparation time, price, and difficulty level for each meal, so that I can decide if the recipe fits my schedule and skill. |
| User 7   | As a user, I want to be able to remove meals from my favorites list, so that I can keep it organized with only the meals I still enjoy.              |
| User 8   | As a user, I want to be able to randomly select a meal if I donâ€™t know what I want.                                                                  |

## Collabriation

Both Anders and Daniel finished the Udemy course separately.
We had a meeting over Discord to find extra features to be added, that was not to easy or obvious.
We agreed that the state handling that was added in the course was suboptimal so we decided to reimplement it with the provider package. By using provider we could have a central place for the states and then get/update this state from anywhere in the app.
We ended up with a way to randomly select a meal, if the user has a hard time choosing for themself, as the extra feature. The button to find the random meal is in the top right of the tabs screen.
When we were both happy with the app, we discussed what to write in our documentation, and then wrote it together while talking over discord.
